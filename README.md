# Scenario development for EITM01 thesis

**Note:** This project expects a functioning setup of
[CIBUSmod](https://github.com/SLU-foodsystems/CIBUSmod) in the parent-directory,
i.e. at `../CIBUSmod/`.

The main files for this project are [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb) and
[`analysis.ipynb`](analysis.ipynb), both requiring a working installation of
jupyter notebooks. The recommended procedure is to install the dependencies of
CIBUSmod in that project directory first (see the corresponding docs), activate
its `venv`, and cd into this directory. In other words, using the dependency
structure of CIBUSmod directly, rather than having explicitly installing
pip-packages in this project.

Scenarios data-files can be found in [`./data/scenarios`](./data/scenarios).

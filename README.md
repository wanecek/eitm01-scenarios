# Scenario development for EITM01 thesis

**Note:** This project expects a functioning setup of
[CIBUSmod](https://github.com/SLU-foodsystems/CIBUSmod) in the parent-directory,
i.e. at `../CIBUSmod/`.

- Scenarios data-files are found in [`./data/scenarios`](./data/scenarios).
- The main file for this project is [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb), which requires a
  working installation of jupyter notebooks. The recommended procedure is to
  install the dependencies of CIBUSmod in the respective directory, activate its
  `venv`, and cd to this directory.
